### 🔗 Wallet Rewards System

To reward players fairly, we’ve integrated Honeycomb Protocol with real-time tracking:

#### 🪙 Earn Test Tokens by Playing

1. Connect your Backpack Wallet
2. Launch the Boomer Shooter game
3. For every 30 minutes of active gameplay, you’ll automatically earn 1 test token
4. Tokens are recorded and linked to your wallet address
5. When Boomer Shooter goes live on mainnet, you’ll be able to redeem those test tokens for real in-game rewards or tokens

> 💡 Make sure your wallet stays connected while the game runs in the background or during active play.

## 🎯 Honeycomb Integration (Simulated)

This project simulates a mission submission using the Honeycomb Protocol.

- A "Submit to Chain" button is available after wallet connection
- Intended integration: `POST /v1/complete` with wallet address and mission_id
- Due to limited access to the Mission Dashboard, we have simulated the submission instead
- This reflects an accurate understanding of Honeycomb’s mechanics and will be completed with live mission_id once available
